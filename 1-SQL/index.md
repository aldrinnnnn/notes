# SQL

A general overview of PostgreSQL-flavored SQL.

```{note}

DATA 101 uses Postgres, but nearly all of the SQL should follow the [SQL Standard][sql_standard]. However, when trying to write a specific query, we recommend consulting the documentation for the specific database system you are using.

Throughout these notes we will be linking to the [**current Postgres documentation**][pg_current]. We encourage you to check the docs which are well-written and comprehensive.
