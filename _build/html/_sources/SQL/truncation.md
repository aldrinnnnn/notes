# Truncating Relations

**Last updated**: August 27, 2024

Sometimes you may want just a portion of rows generated by a query.

## LIMIT and OFFSET

Sometimes we want to limit the result to a few tuples via `LIMIT <val>`.
For example, say we want to order Stops by descending age, return top
15:

    SELECT *
    FROM Stops
    ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 15;

Sometimes we want to start the output at a particular point via
`OFFSET <val>`. For example, say we want to order Stops by descending
age, return positions 11 to 15:

## Sampling

```{note}
[09/02/2024] The full section is here for your convenience, but for Lectures 02 / Project 1 you are likely only expected to know the first option. We will learn more about `TABLESAMPLE` around Lecture 07 once you learn memory structures.
```

We can also *sample* tuples, or select a subset of tuples. This is
desirable when the original dataset might be too large, and you want to
experiment quickly before running operations on the full dataset. There
are 3 sampling methods discussed in this class:

-   `SELECT * FROM Table ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT N`: randomly sorts the
    rows of the table and takes the first $n$ rows.

-   `SELECT * FROM Table TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI(percentage p)`: takes a
    $p\%$ uniform random sample based on flipping a p%-probability coin

-   `SELECT * FROM Table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM(percentage p)`: tuples are
    grouped in pages on disk, so $p\%$ of pages are uniformly randomly
    selected

`RANDOM` is expensive for large tables, because we must first compute all resulting rows, then sort all the rows before returning a truncated subset.
While `BERNOULLI` is faster than `RANDOM`, it is slower than
`SYSTEM`, due to more random accesses. `SYSTEM` is therefore the fastest
method, but the least "random" due to page-level sampling.
