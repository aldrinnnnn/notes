title: Data 101 Course Notes

# Overview

This is an in-progress **notes repository** for Data 101: Data Engineering, UC Berkeley ([Data 101 homepage](https://data101.org/)).

This repository is updated semi-weekly and is meant to be used *in addition to* lecture. In other words, these notes contain core concepts for reference, whereas lecture contains activities and demos for internalizing the concepts.

## Table of Contents

Chapters are bundled by topic, not by lecture number. This means that content can appear out of order compared to what is presented in lecture. We will try to indicate this where possible.

Navigate with the sidebar or with the links below:

## Course Acknowledgments

The content and structure of Data Engineering have been designed and developed over the years thanks to many dedicated faculty and instructors at UC Berkeley.

Valuable and essential instructional contributors (alphabetical order): Joe Hellerstein, Lakshya Jain, Aditya Parameswaran, and Lisa Yan.

Course notes in particular were developed over many semesters by many teaching assistants. Thank you!!
